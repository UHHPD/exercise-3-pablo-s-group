# Poisson Distribution Statistical Analysis

## Overview
This is a C++ educational project focused on statistical analysis using Poisson distribution. The project is part of a German language physics/statistics course that analyzes a dataset of 234 numerical values.

**Project Type:** Command-line C++ application  
**Language:** C++ (C++11 standard)  
**Compiler:** Clang++  
**Data File:** datensumme.txt (234 integer values)

## Purpose
The project consists of two main programs:
1. **poisson** - Analyzes frequency distribution and compares with Poisson distribution predictions
2. **likelihood** - Performs Maximum Likelihood estimation and statistical hypothesis testing

## Project Structure
```
.
├── poisson.cc         # Poisson distribution analysis program
├── likelihood.cc      # Maximum likelihood estimation program
├── datensumme.txt     # Data file with 234 numerical values
├── Makefile          # Build configuration
└── README.md         # German language assignment instructions
```

## Build System
The project uses a Makefile with the following targets:
- `make all` - Compiles both programs (default)
- `make poisson` - Compiles only the poisson program
- `make likelihood` - Compiles only the likelihood program
- `make clean` - Removes compiled binaries and generated output files

Compilation flags:
- C++11 standard (`-std=c++11`)
- All warnings enabled (`-Wall`)

## Development Setup
The project is configured to automatically compile on file changes via the Replit workflow system.

### Workflow
- **compile** - Runs `make all` to build both programs

### Running the Programs
After compilation, you can run the programs from the shell:
```bash
./poisson
./likelihood
```

## Current State
The project has been imported from GitHub and set up in the Replit environment with:
- ✅ C++ compiler (Clang++) installed
- ✅ Makefile created for building the project
- ✅ .gitignore configured for C++ project artifacts
- ✅ Automatic compilation workflow configured
- ✅ Both programs compile successfully

The source files contain template/skeleton code that needs to be implemented according to the assignment requirements in README.md.

## Recent Changes
- **2025-11-08**: Initial project setup in Replit
  - Installed C++ compiler toolchain
  - Created Makefile for build automation
  - Updated .gitignore for C++ project files
  - Configured automatic compilation workflow
  - Verified successful compilation of both programs

## Notes
- This is an educational project with German language instructions
- The programs perform statistical analysis on the data in datensumme.txt
- Output files (hist.txt, histpoi.txt, likelihood.txt, nll.txt, deltanll.txt) are generated by the programs
- The assignment mentions using gnuplot for visualization (not included in this Replit setup)
